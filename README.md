# ClassClient



ClassClient demonstrates the use of classes in c++

To build:


Follow same steps as AdvancedProject building but instead of building AdvancedProject, build ClassCllient.


NOTE: The original name for this project was UltimateClient.



Another NOTE: The project uses only h.hpp but I was once testing something so I created Filex.cpp and File.hpp but now they are unused but don't remove them

else an linker error may occur.
