# ClassClient



ClassClient demonstrates the use of classes in c++

To build:


Follow same steps as AdvancedProject building but instead of building AdvancedProject, build ClassCllient.


NOTE: The original name for this project was UltimateClient.



Another NOTE: The project uses only h.hpp but I was once testing something so I created Filex.cpp and File.hpp but now they are unused but don't remove them
else an linker error may occur.


To run:

Run from either cmd or visual studio 2022 but don't run directly because there is no function to pause the program which means that it will exit so you won't be able
to see the output.
